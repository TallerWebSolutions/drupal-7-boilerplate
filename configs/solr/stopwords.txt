 | An English stop word list. Comments begin with vertical bar. Each stop
 | word is at the start of a line.

 | Many of the forms below are quite rare (e.g. "yourselves") but included for
 |  completeness.

           | PRONOUNS FORMS
             | 1st person sing

i              | subject, always in upper case of course

me             | object
my             | possessive adjective
               | the possessive pronoun `mine' is best suppressed, because of the
               | sense of coal-mine etc.
myself         | reflexive
             | 1st person plural
we             | subject

| us           | object
               | care is required here because US = United States. It is usually
               | safe to remove it if it is in lower case.
our            | possessive adjective
ours           | possessive pronoun
ourselves      | reflexive
             | second person (archaic `thou' forms not included)
you            | subject and object
your           | possessive adjective

his            | possessive adjective and pronoun

she            | subject
her            | object and possessive adjective

it             | subject and object
its            | possessive adjective
itself         | reflexive
             | third person plural
they           | subject
them           | object
their          | possessive adjective

           | VERB FORMS (using F.R. Palmer's nomenclature)
             | BE
am             | 1st person, present
is             | -s form (3rd person, present)
are            | present
was            | 1st person, past
were           | past

had            | past
having         | -ing form
             | DO
do             | simple
does           | -s form
did            | past
doing          | -ing form

 | The forms below are, I believe, best omitted, because of the significant
 | homonym forms:

 |  He made a WILL
 |  old tin CAN
 |  merry month of MAY
 |  a smell of MUST
 |  fight the good fight with all thy MIGHT

 | would, could, should, ought might however be included
