{"name":"Drupal-boilerplate","tagline":"Boilerplate project for drupal development","body":"### Drupal Boilerplate.\r\nDrupal boilerplate is not a module. Instead it just serves as a directory structure for starting a new drupal site. The idea behind Drupal boilerplate came from working on so many different sites which each follow their own development practice, directory structure, deployment guidelines, etc...\r\n\r\nDrupal boilerplate tries to simplifies starting a new site by having the most common directory structures and files already included and set up.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nYou can start by [downloading](https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/zipball/master)\r\nthis project. Once you download it you will fine every folder contains a readme.md file\r\nin it. This readme.md file has been extensively documented to explain what belongs\r\nin that specific directory.\r\n\r\nHere's a breakdown for what each directory/file is used for. If you want to know more please\r\nread the readme inside the specific directory.\r\n\r\n* [docroot](https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/tree/master/docroot)\r\n * Where your drupal root should start.\r\n* [drush](https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/tree/master/drush)\r\n * Contains project specific drush commands, alias, and configurations.\r\n* [results](https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/tree/master/results)\r\n * This directory is just used to export test results to. A good example of this\r\n   is when running drush test-run with the --xml option. You can export the xml\r\n   to this directory for parsing by external tools.\r\n* [test](https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/tree/master/test)\r\n * A directory for external test. This is great for non drupal specific test\r\n such as selenium, qunit, casperjs.\r\n* [.gitignore](https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal-boilerplate/blob/master/.gitignore)\r\n * Contains the a list of the most common excluded files.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor: Eric J.
